# Getting Started with RapidTriageME

Welcome to **RapidTriageME** - the AI-powered browser debugging platform that revolutionizes how you debug, analyze, and optimize web applications. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started.

## What is RapidTriageME?

RapidTriageME is a comprehensive browser debugging platform that enables AI assistants to interact with web browsers through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It captures real-time browser data including console logs, network requests, errors, and performance metrics, making them available to your favorite AI coding assistants.

### Key Benefits

- **AI-Powered Debugging** - Let AI assistants analyze browser issues for you
- **Real-time Data Capture** - Monitor console logs, network requests, and errors as they happen  
- **Cross-Platform** - Works with 10+ IDEs and AI assistants
- **Remote Debugging** - Debug browsers anywhere with cloud deployment
- **Comprehensive Audits** - Built-in Lighthouse integration for performance, accessibility, SEO
- **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults

## How It Works

RapidTriageME consists of three main components working together:

```

1. **Chrome Extension** - Captures browser data through DevTools API
2. **Browser Connector** - Local server (port 3025) that processes and aggregates data
3. **MCP Server** - Bridges data to AI assistants using Model Context Protocol

## Installation Overview

Getting started requires three simple steps:

!!! tip "Quick Setup (5 minutes)"
    1. **Install Chrome Extension** - Load the unpacked extension
    2. **Start Browser Server** - Run `npx @yarlisai/rapidtriage-server`
